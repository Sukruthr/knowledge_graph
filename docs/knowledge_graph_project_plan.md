 Knowledge Graph Construction Project Plan

  Project Overview

  You have excellent biological data sources:
  - Gene Ontology (GO) data: Standardized vocabulary describing gene functions, cellular processes, and biological
  pathways
  - Hallmark gene sets: Curated collections of genes representing well-defined biological processes
  - LLM evaluation data: Research data for gene set interpretation

  Think of this like building a digital map of biology where genes are cities, pathways are highways, and functions
   are neighborhoods.

  Phase 1: KG Schema Design (The Blueprint)

  1. Identify Entities (Nodes)

  Based on your data, here are the primary entities:

  - Gene: Individual genetic units (e.g., "TP53", "BCL2")
  - Gene Set: Collections of genes sharing biological functions (e.g., "HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS")
  - GO Term: Standardized biological concepts (e.g., "GO:0006915" for apoptotic process)
  - Pathway: Biological processes or molecular interactions
  - Biological Process: Specific cellular activities (GO:BP)
  - Molecular Function: What genes do at molecular level (GO:MF)
  - Cellular Component: Where genes act in the cell (GO:CC)

  2. Identify Relationships (Edges)

  Key relationships with directions:
  - (Gene) -> [MEMBER_OF] -> (Gene_Set)
  - (Gene) -> [ANNOTATED_WITH] -> (GO_Term)
  - (GO_Term) -> [IS_A] -> (GO_Term) (hierarchical)
  - (GO_Term) -> [PART_OF] -> (GO_Term) (compositional)
  - (Gene_Set) -> [ENRICHED_FOR] -> (GO_Term)
  - (Gene) -> [HAS_FUNCTION] -> (Molecular_Function)
  - (Gene) -> [PARTICIPATES_IN] -> (Biological_Process)
  - (Gene) -> [LOCATED_IN] -> (Cellular_Component)

  3. Define Properties

  Gene Node Properties:
  - symbol: Gene symbol (e.g., "TP53")
  - entrez_id: Numerical identifier
  - uniprot_id: Protein identifier
  - description: Full gene name

  Gene Set Properties:
  - name: Set identifier (e.g., "HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS")
  - description: Biological description
  - source: Data source (e.g., "MSigDB", "GO")
  - size: Number of genes

  GO Term Properties:
  - go_id: Unique GO identifier (e.g., "GO:0006915")
  - name: Human-readable term
  - namespace: Category (BP/MF/CC)
  - definition: Detailed description

  4. Schema Visualization

   |----[ANNOTATED_WITH]-----> GO_Term
   |                           |
   |----[HAS_FUNCTION]-------> Molecular_Function

                          [IS_A/PART_OF]
                               |
                               v
                            GO_Term

  Phase 2: KG Construction Plan (The Build)

  1. Technology Stack Recommendation

  Recommended: Neo4j Community Edition

  Pros:
  - Beginner-friendly with graphical interface
  - Excellent query language (Cypher)
  - Great visualization tools
  - Free community version
  - Extensive documentation

  Cons:
  - Requires learning Cypher
  - Can be resource-intensive for very large graphs

  Alternative: Python NetworkX (for simpler start)
  - Pure Python, no database setup
  - Good for prototyping and analysis
  - Easy integration with pandas
  - Limited scalability

  2. Data Ingestion Pipeline

  Step 1: Environment Setup
  # Install dependencies
  pip install neo4j pandas pyyaml networkx

  Step 2: Parse Gene Sets (.gmt and .yaml files)
  import pandas as pd
  import yaml

  def parse_gmt_file(filepath):
      """Parse GMT format gene sets"""
      gene_sets = {}
      with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
          for line in f:
              parts = line.strip().split('\t')
              set_name = parts[0]
              genes = parts[2:]  # Skip description column
              gene_sets[set_name] = genes
      return gene_sets

  def parse_yaml_geneset(filepath):
      """Parse YAML format gene sets"""
      with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
          data = yaml.safe_load(f)
      return {
          'name': data['name'],
          'genes': data['gene_symbols'],
          'description': data.get('description'),
          'taxon': data.get('taxon')
      }

  Step 3: Parse GO Data
  def parse_go_terms(filepath):
      """Parse GO term definitions"""
      go_terms = {}
      with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
          for line in f:
              if line.startswith('GO:'):
                  parts = line.strip().split('\t')
                  go_id = parts[0]
                  name = parts[1]
                  go_terms[go_id] = name
      return go_terms

  Step 4: Create Neo4j Connection and Load Data
  from neo4j import GraphDatabase

  class KnowledgeGraphBuilder:
      def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
          self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

      def create_gene_nodes(self, genes):
          with self.driver.session() as session:
              for gene in genes:
                  session.run(
                      "MERGE (g:Gene {symbol: $symbol})",
                      symbol=gene
                  )

      def create_geneset_relationships(self, gene_sets):
          with self.driver.session() as session:
              for set_name, genes in gene_sets.items():
                  # Create gene set node
                  session.run(
                      "MERGE (gs:GeneSet {name: $name})",
                      name=set_name
                  )
                  # Create relationships
                  for gene in genes:
                      session.run(
                          """
                          MATCH (g:Gene {symbol: $gene})
                          MATCH (gs:GeneSet {name: $set_name})
                          MERGE (g)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(gs)
                          """,
                          gene=gene, set_name=set_name
                      )

  Phase 3: Information Extraction (Using the KG)

  1. Sample Queries

  Simple Queries:
  1. "Which genes are in the 'HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS' gene set?"
  2. "What GO terms are associated with gene 'TP53'?"
  3. "How many genes are in each hallmark gene set?"

  Intermediate Queries:
  4. "Find all gene sets that contain the gene 'BCL2'"
  5. "What are the top 10 most common GO terms across all gene sets?"

  Complex Queries:
  6. "Find all biological pathways that share at least 5 genes with 'HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS'"
  7. "Identify genes that appear in multiple hallmark pathways related to cell death"

  2. Cypher Query Examples

  Query 1: Genes in HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS
  MATCH (g:Gene)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(gs:GeneSet {name: 'HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS'})
  RETURN g.symbol AS gene_symbol
  ORDER BY gene_symbol

  Query 6: Pathways sharing genes with apoptosis
  MATCH (g:Gene)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(apoptosis:GeneSet {name: 'HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS'})
  MATCH (g)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(other:GeneSet)
  WHERE other.name <> 'HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS'
  WITH other, COUNT(g) as shared_genes
  WHERE shared_genes >= 5
  RETURN other.name, shared_genes
  ORDER BY shared_genes DESC

  Query 7: Multi-pathway death genes
  MATCH (g:Gene)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(gs:GeneSet)
  WHERE gs.name CONTAINS 'APOPTOSIS' OR gs.name CONTAINS 'DEATH'
  WITH g, COUNT(gs) as pathway_count
  WHERE pathway_count > 1
  RETURN g.symbol, pathway_count
  ORDER BY pathway_count DESC

  Phase 4: Evaluation Framework (Quality Control)

  1. Defining "Good" - Evaluation Criteria

  A. Correctness: Are the biological facts accurate?
  B. Completeness: How much domain knowledge does our KG capture?
  C. Utility: Can the KG effectively answer research questions?

  2. Evaluation Methods

  A. Correctness Assessment
  - Method: Manual validation against trusted sources
  - Implementation:
    - Sample 100 random gene-GO term associations
    - Cross-check against NCBI Gene database
    - Verify gene set memberships against MSigDB
    - Calculate accuracy percentage

  B. Completeness Measurement
  - Coverage Metrics:
    - Percentage of human genes represented
    - GO term coverage across all three namespaces
    - Pathway representation breadth
  - Implementation:
  def calculate_coverage(kg_genes, reference_genes):
      coverage = len(set(kg_genes) & set(reference_genes)) / len(reference_genes)
      return coverage * 100

  C. Utility Testing
  - Benchmark Questions: Create 20 biologically meaningful questions
  - Success Metrics:
    - Query success rate (can we get an answer?)
    - Answer relevance (is the answer biologically meaningful?)
    - Query performance (response time)

  D. Link Prediction for Quality Assessment
  - Concept: Predict missing gene-pathway associations based on existing patterns
  - Implementation: Use graph embeddings to identify likely missing connections
  - Validation: Check predictions against literature or additional databases

  3. Automated Quality Checks

  def run_quality_checks(graph):
      checks = {
          'orphan_genes': count_genes_without_genesets(graph),
          'empty_genesets': count_empty_genesets(graph),
          'duplicate_relationships': find_duplicate_edges(graph),
          'inconsistent_naming': check_gene_symbol_consistency(graph)
      }
      return checks
