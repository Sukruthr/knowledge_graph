Comprehensive Quality Control Implementation Plan

    Executive Summary

    Create a production-grade QC framework for your 9-phase biomedical knowledge graph with 135K+ nodes, 3.8M+ edges, 
    covering GO ontology + multi-modal omics + LLM evaluations.

    Key Implementation Strategy

    Phase 1: Build & Persist Complete KG

    - Build full knowledge graph once (~37 seconds)
    - Save to optimized format (pkl + NetworkX + Neo4j export)
    - All subsequent QC tests use pre-built graph (no rebuild needed)
    - Validate save/load integrity and performance

    Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment

    1. Structural Integrity (15 comprehensive checks)
    2. Data Quality (Cross-reference with 5+ authoritative sources)  
    3. Functional Testing (All 97 methods + 200+ biological queries)
    4. Integration Quality (9-phase data source validation)
    5. Semantic Validation (Biological logic & consistency)
    6. Performance Benchmarks (Load testing + memory profiling)

    Phase 3: Automated QC Pipeline

    - Master QC orchestrator script running all validations
    - Comprehensive reporting with pass/fail criteria
    - Detailed logs for each QC dimension
    - Executive summary with production readiness assessment

    Expected Outcomes

    - Complete KG Validation: Every component thoroughly tested
    - Production Certification: Ready-to-deploy quality assessment
    - Performance Benchmarks: Scalability and efficiency metrics
    - Quality Metrics: Quantified biological accuracy and completeness
    - Regression Protection: Automated testing for future changes

    Estimated Timeline: 2-3 hours comprehensive QC execution
    Expected Result: Production-ready biomedical knowledge graph with comprehensive quality certification
