==================================================

## EXISTING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH COVERAGE
GO Namespaces: GO_BP, GO_CC, GO_MF
Omics Data Types: 6 files
Model Comparison Data: No
LLM Processed Data: No
GO Analysis Data: Yes

## GO_BP GMT FILE OVERLAP ANALYSIS
### Data Sizes
Existing GO_BP data: 15770 terms, 11943 genes
New GMT data: 11943 terms, 17023 genes

### Overlap Statistics
Overlapping GO terms: 9075 (76.0% of new data)
Overlapping genes: 0 (0.0% of new data)
Overlapping term-gene pairs: 0 (0.0% of new data)

### New Value Assessment
New GO terms: 2868 (24.0% of new data)
New genes: 17023 (100.0% of new data)
New term-gene pairs: 1349032 (100.0% of new data)

### RECOMMENDATION: INTEGRATE
The GMT file provides 100.0% new gene-term associations.
This represents significant new value and should be integrated.

## INTEGRATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMAINING FILES
### reference_evaluation.tsv
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Reason**: Literature evaluation data - complements existing gene-GO associations with citation context
**Recommendation**: INTEGRATE - Adds new dimension of literature support

### L1000_sep_count_DF.txt
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Reason**: Expression perturbation data - different from existing GO associations
**Recommendation**: INTEGRATE - Adds experimental perturbation context

### all_go_terms_embeddings_dict.pkl
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Reason**: Embedding vectors - computational representation of GO terms
**Recommendation**: INTEGRATE - Enables similarity computations and ML applications

### SupplementTable3_0715.tsv
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Reason**: Large supplementary table - need to examine content for overlap
**Recommendation**: EXAMINE FIRST - Check for overlap with existing LLM evaluation data

### go_terms.csv
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Reason**: GO terms data - likely overlaps with existing GO ontology data
**Recommendation**: COMPARE FIRST - May duplicate existing GO term information
