## Migration Architecture Validation

### Before Migration
```
src/kg_builder.py (3,783 lines)
├── GOKnowledgeGraph (17 methods)
├── CombinedGOKnowledgeGraph (8 methods)  
└── ComprehensiveBiomedicalKnowledgeGraph (72 methods)
Total: 97 methods in single file
```

### After Migration  
```
src/kg_builders/
├── __init__.py                     # Backward compatibility interface
├── shared_utils.py                 # 4 common utility functions
├── go_knowledge_graph.py          # 17 methods (100% preserved)
├── combined_go_graph.py           # 8 methods (100% preserved)
└── comprehensive_graph.py         # 72 methods (100% preserved)
Total: 97 methods across 5 focused files
```

## Functionality Verification

### Core Features Validated ✅

2. **Omics Data Integration** (6 data sources)
3. **Model Comparison Data** (5 LLM models)  
4. **CC/MF Branch Analysis** (Enhanced interpretations)
5. **Multi-Model LLM Processing** (8 models)
6. **GO Analysis Data** (Core datasets + enrichment)
7. **Remaining High-Value Data** (GMT, L1000, embeddings)
8. **Talisman Gene Sets** (HALLMARK pathways)

### Query Methods Validated ✅
- **Gene Queries:** `query_gene_comprehensive()` - Working
- **GO Term Queries:** `query_go_term()` - Working

## Backward Compatibility Verification

### Old Import Style (Deprecated but Functional)
```python
from kg_builder import ComprehensiveBiomedicalKnowledgeGraph  # Works with warning
```

### New Import Style (Recommended)  
```python
from kg_builders import ComprehensiveBiomedicalKnowledgeGraph  # Clean import
```

Both styles produce identical functionality - verified through comprehensive testing.
