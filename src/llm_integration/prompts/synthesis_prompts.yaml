# Error Handling and Fallback Template
fallback: |
  I encountered some challenges while processing your biomedical question, but I can provide the following information based on available data:

  Question: {question}

  Available Information:
  {available_data}

  To get a more complete answer, you might try:
  - Rephrasing the question with more specific terms
  - Asking about individual components (genes, diseases, drugs) separately  
  - Focusing on a particular aspect (function, mechanism, associations)
  - Using alternative gene names or synonyms

  I'm designed to help with questions about genes, diseases, drugs, biological pathways, and their interactions based on our comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph.
