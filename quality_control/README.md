# Comprehensive Quality Control Framework

## Overview

This is a production-grade Quality Control (QC) framework for the biomedical knowledge graph system. The framework provides comprehensive validation across all dimensions: structural integrity, data quality, functional correctness, integration quality, semantic validation, performance benchmarks, regression testing, and production readiness.

## QC Phases

### Phase 1: Build & Persist Complete KG
- **Objective**: Build the complete knowledge graph once and persist it for all subsequent QC tests
- **Duration**: ~37 seconds (one-time cost)
- **Output**: Optimized graph files (pkl, NetworkX, Neo4j export)
- **Benefit**: All QC tests use pre-built graph (no rebuild needed)

### Phase 2: Structural Integrity Validation
- **Objective**: Validate graph topology, schema adherence, and structural consistency
- **Tests**: 15 comprehensive structural checks
- **Coverage**: Node types, edge types, properties, relationships, topology

### Phase 3: Data Quality Validation  
- **Objective**: Ensure biological accuracy and data completeness
- **Cross-references**: 5+ authoritative sources (GO, HGNC, NCBI, etc.)
- **Coverage**: Gene symbols, GO terms, associations, expression data

### Phase 4: Functional Testing
- **Objective**: Test all methods and query capabilities
- **Coverage**: All 97 methods + 200+ biological queries
- **Validation**: Query results, error handling, edge cases

### Phase 5: Integration Quality
- **Objective**: Validate seamless integration across all 9 data phases
- **Coverage**: Gene identifier mapping, cross-modal connectivity, parser chain integrity
- **Focus**: Multi-modal data consistency and completeness

### Phase 6: Semantic Validation
- **Objective**: Ensure biological accuracy and logical consistency
- **Coverage**: GO hierarchies, pathway coherence, expression logic, model predictions
- **Validation**: Biological sensibility of all relationships and predictions

### Phase 7: Performance Benchmarks
- **Objective**: Validate scalability and efficiency
- **Coverage**: Construction time, query performance, memory usage, load testing
- **Targets**: ~37s construction, 1500+ queries/sec, memory profiling

### Phase 8: Regression Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure backward compatibility and stability
- **Coverage**: Import compatibility, method preservation, result consistency
- **Protection**: Against breaking changes in future updates

### Phase 9: Production Readiness Assessment
- **Objective**: Final certification for deployment
- **Deliverables**: Executive summary, quality metrics, deployment recommendations
- **Certification**: Production-ready status determination

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /home/mreddy1/knowledge_graph/quality_control
python run_comprehensive_qc.py
```

### Individual Phase Testing
```bash
# Phase 1: Build and save KG
python 1_build_and_save_kg/build_complete_kg.py

# Phase 2: Structural integrity
python 2_structural_integrity/structural_validation.py

# Continue with other phases...
```

### Expected Execution Time
- **Phase 1 (Build KG)**: ~37 seconds (one-time)
- **Phases 2-8 (All QC Tests)**: ~60-90 minutes
- **Phase 9 (Reporting)**: ~5 minutes
- **Total**: ~2-3 hours comprehensive validation

## Quality Metrics

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Structural Integrity**: 100% schema compliance, <1% orphaned nodes
